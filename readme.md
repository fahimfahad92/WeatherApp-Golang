This is my template project using Golang. I used the Weather API to perform external API calling. Also added sample code to use config properties.Â 

**Prerequisite:** Install Golang SDK

**Routing:** chi

**Configuration:** viper

This microservice consists of 2 APIs.
1. Get current weather
2. Get weather forecast
